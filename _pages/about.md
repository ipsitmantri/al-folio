Good Day! I'm Ipsit, a senior undergraduate at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) majoring in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/academics/curriculum/btechnew#SEM1) and pursuing a dual minor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) and the [Center for Machine Intelligence and Data Science](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/).

## Research Interests

My broad area of interest is machine learning and applied machine learning. Currently I am working under [Prof. Abir De](https://abir-de.github.io/) on developing neural networks that can learn combinatorial optimization algorithms on graphs.

Currently, I am working on my Undergraduate Thesis in the area of Graph Representation Learning and Machine Learning on Structured Data.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
