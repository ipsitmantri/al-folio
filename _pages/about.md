I am a 2nd year MS student at [Purdue Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu). I recently finished an internship at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/) in Tokyo, JP in Summer 2024. In a previous life, I was an undergraduate student at [IIT Bombay Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/index.php) from 2018-2022. I am currently looking for PhD positions (Summer/Fall 2025 start) in geometric and topological representation learning.

<!-- I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) with Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/academics/curriculum/btechnew#SEM1) and minor in (1) [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) and (2) [Artificial Intelligence and Data Science](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/). -->

<!-- ## Research Interests -->
Recently I am fascinated and motivated to learn about **geometry and topology-aware representation learning**. I believe that there are lot of symmetries hidden in this world. I am motivated, for the conceivable future (next 10 years) to make this my mission to uncover those symmetries and propose new
applications of artificial intelligence. The following masterpiece inspires me

I am fortunate to be working with [Dr. Moshe Eliasof](https://maths4dl.ac.uk/team-member/moshe-eliasof) and [Beatrice Bevilacqua](https://beabevi.github.io/) and to be advised by [Prof. Bruno Ribeiro](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ribeirob/). I am grateful to [Prof. Abir De](https://abir-de.github.io/) for advising, mentoring and motivating me to do research while I was at IITB. At Sony, I am doing research on topologically grounded 3D scene generation. I briefly worked on LLMs for supply chain optimization with [Prof. Can Li](https://canli1.github.io/).
