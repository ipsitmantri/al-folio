<!-- For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like! -->
I have made notes for some of the courses that I took at [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in){:target="_blank"} during my undergrad.
