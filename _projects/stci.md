This work was done when I was a software engineer intern at Microsoft India Development Center, Hyderabad. My manager was [Niraj Bhilegaonkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nirajbhilegaonkar/) and my mentor was [Abhishek Gangwar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-gangwar-5299025a/).
- Developed a framework to automate the query expansion process to improve agility and quality using crowdsource
- Reduced query treatment time from 1 day to 3 hours by using query sampling techniques to minimize the budget
- Built a job manager for submitting and tracking multiple workflows enabling concurrency without conflicts
